# Oceanographic-Processes

The course taken at UNSW focused on utilising MATLAB to input data files physical ocean properties: sea surface height, sea surface temperature, chlorophyll concentration, surface currents, etc, to investigate proceses such as eddies, Western Boundary Currents, ENSO events, Marine Heat Waves and primary productivity. Attached are mlx files of source code for a few example assignments, data files and functions, and example figures.
